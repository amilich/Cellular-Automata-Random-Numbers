This Python module generates random numbers using a Cellular Automata. 
A CA is first generated according to Rule 30, which generates pseudorandom patterns. 
The number of 1's and 0's in a particular column is then counted and converted
into a decimal number. 

The module was tested with various Diehard tests to measure randomness; against 
the Python built in random function, it provided more even (random) distributions.
